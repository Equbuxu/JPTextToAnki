# JPTextToAnki

A console app I wrote to aid in my study of japanese. It automatically generates anki decks based on a japanese text. For example, if you have a song that you enjoy but don't really understand you can use the app to make a deck with all the words from the song. Then, once you have learned all the cards, you will (hopefully) understand the whole song. 

![Example card](/card-example.png?raw=true "Example card")

The app takes text as input, extracts words from it, and creates an anki card for each of them. The word definitions are fetched from [jisho](https://jisho.org/). You can either choose to use `tiny-segmenter` or `nagisa` as the text segmentation engine. `nagisa` tends to produce fewer garbage cards and generally do a better job, but it is also harder to set up.

# Running the app with tiny-segmenter

First, you need to download the repo and install the required node modules. I'm running Windows 11 and Node v16.15.1. Other node versions should work as well.

```
git clone https://github.com/Equbuxu/JPTextToAnki.git
cd .\JPTextToAnki\
npm install
```

Then, put a .txt file with your text into `files/inputs`. Then, open `files/config.json` and find the line that says:

```
"input":"files/inputs/Omoi-Teo.txt"
```

Change `Omoi-Teo.txt` to the name of your file. Also, change `input-type` to `text-tiny-segmenter` since we don't want to bother with setting up Nagisa just yet. Now build the app and run it:

```
npx tsc
node build/index.js
```

You should end up with two files int `files/output`: `output-kanji.txt` and `output-words.txt`.

# Importing cards into Anki

First, you'll need to create a new card type for the generated cards. Go into Tools -> Manage Note Types -> Add -> Add: Basic -> OK. Select the newly created type and click `Cards`. There, choose `Styling` and replace the default styles with these:

```css
.card {
 font-size: 24pt;
 text-align: left;
 color: black;
 background-color: #FFFAF0;
 font-family: yuumichou;
 line-height: 1.2em;
}

.weak {
 font-size: 16pt;
 color: gray;
 display:block;
 margin-top: 10px;
 line-height: 0.9;
}

.inline-weak {
 font-size: 16pt;
 color: gray;
}

.card-front {
 font-weight: bold;
 font-size: 35pt;
}

.title {
 font-weight: bold;
 margin-top: 5px; 
 margin-left: 30px;
 height: 35px
}

.info {
 font-size: 16pt;
}
```

This only needs to be done once, and now you will be able to import the file generated by the app.

Press `Import File` on the main anki screen and choose the generated `output-words.txt`. Choose the previously created card type instead of Basic. Pick a deck for the cards or create a new one. Make sure `Allow HTML in fields` is ticked. Press `Import`. That's it!

# Using Nagisa

`Nagisa` is a library for text segmentation. It's a python library, but the rest of the project is written in typescript. Because of that I'm using `Nagisa` in a small python server that provides a text segmentation api. You'll need to run that server alongside the main app. First, install python 3.8 if you don't already have it. Then, from the project root do:

```
cd split-words-server
py -3.8 -m pip install nagisa
py -3.8 split-words.py
```

This will launch the server on `localhost:8000`. After that you can follow the instructions from `Running the app with tiny-segmenter`, but change `input-type` to `text-nagisa` in the config file.
